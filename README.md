*Firebase* is one of the most popular BaaS because of its amazing capabilities and ability to setup a serverless backend in seconds. 
However, it is complex to upload bulks of existing data as it lacks such tools in the console. 
So, I've built a really simple web app that reads .CSV file and performs the upload via Firebase REST API.
<br />

### FUNCTIONALITY:
To allow the user to upload CSV file that will be updated immediately into the Realtime Database in Firebase.
<br />

### TOOLS USED:
* React js
* Firebase - Realtime Database
* Two npm packages:
 1. react-dropzone (for the user to drop .csv file)
 2. csv (to read the csv file)
