## React website to upload CSV file to Firebase

*Firebase* is one of the most popular BaaS because of its amazing capabilities and ability to setup a serverless backend in seconds. 
However, it is complex to upload bulks of existing data as it lacks such tools in the console. 
So, I've Built a really simple web app that reads .CSV file and performs the upload via Firebase REST API.

## TOOLS USED:
* React js
* Firebase
* 2 npm packages:
- react-dropzone (for the user to drop .csv file)
- csv (to read the csv file)
